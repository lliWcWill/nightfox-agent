# rotate-logs.sh — Rotate a log file on service restart.
#
# Called via ExecStartPre= in the systemd unit so each service session
# gets a fresh log file. Old logs are numbered .1 (newest) through .N
# (oldest). When MAX_ROTATED is exceeded the oldest file is deleted.
#
# Usage: rotate-logs.sh <logfile> [max_rotated]
#   logfile       — path to the active log (e.g. logs/discord.prod.log)
#   max_rotated   — number of rotated copies to keep (default 10)
